# Higher-Lower-Game
The Higher Lower Game challenges players to guess if Social Media followers for a term are higher or lower than the previous one. It fetches search data, processes it, and tracks scores. A simple UI can enhance the experience. The game flows until the player gets it wrong, displaying a final score.
